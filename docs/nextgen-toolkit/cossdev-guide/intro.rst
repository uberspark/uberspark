Introduction
============

The |uberspark| |cosslong| (|coss|) Developer's Guide describes the various framework elements,
and development and verification work-flow that aims to enable seamless integration into an existing 
|coss| source-code base. 

This guide is primarily intended for |coss| stack developers who are interested in refactoring their existing
legacy code-base to take advantage of |uberspark|'s capabilities.

..  note::  A working installation and knowledge of the general |uberspark| framework is a pre-requisite for 
            the |coss| Developer's Guide. See |genuser-guide-ref|:::ref:`genuser-guide-intro`
            for details.

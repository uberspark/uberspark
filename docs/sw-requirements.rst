Software Requirements and Dependencies
======================================

We assume your are working in: ``/home/<home-dir>/<work-dir>``

Replace ``<home-dir>`` with your home-directory name and ``<work-dir>``
with any working directory of your choice.

Development OS and Base Packages
--------------------------------

You will need a working Ubuntu 16.04.x LTS 64-bit environment for development and 
verification. This can either be a Virtual Machine (VM) (e.g., VirtualBox) or a 
container (e.g., Windows WSL). As of this writing, the Ubuntu 16.04.x LTS VM ISO 
image is available at:

.. parsed-literal::

    http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/ubuntu-16.04.6-desktop-amd64.iso

You will need to first perform an ``update`` to download the latest package
lists from the repositories as shown below:

::

    sudo apt-get update

After the update completes, you will need to install the following base
packages required for development as shown below:

::

   sudo apt-get install git gcc binutils autoconf 
   sudo apt-get install lib32z1 lib32ncurses5 gcc-multilib
   sudo apt-get install ocaml ocaml-findlib ocaml-native-compilers 
   sudo apt-get install graphviz libzarith-ocaml-dev libfindlib-ocaml-dev 
   sudo apt-get install make unzip 


.. _swreqs_documentation:

Packages for Generating Documentation
-------------------------------------

Optionally, you will need to install Latex, Python and Sphinx in order to 
generate the documentation locally for |uspark|. More specifically, you will need 
to perform the following operations:

::

    sudo apt install python3 python3-pip 
    sudo apt install texlive-latex-recommended texlive-fonts-recommended 
    sudo apt install texlive-latex-extra latexmk
	pip3 install -U 'Sphinx==2.2.0'



OCaml Compiler and Base Packages
--------------------------------

You will then need to install the OCaml Package manager as shown below:

::

    wget https://raw.github.com/ocaml/opam/master/shell/opam_installer.sh -O - | sh -s /usr/local/bin

After the OCaml Package Manager installs successfully, configure the opam environment and switch to
the appropriate OCaml compiler version as shown below:

::

    eval `opam config env` 
    opam switch 4.02.3

After the opam environment switch, install the following opam packages in order:

::

    opam install zarith.1.3
    opam install yojson.1.2.1 
    opam install menhir.20170712
    opam install ocamlgraph.1.8.8
    opam install ocamlfind.1.7.3
    eval `opam config env`
 

Coq Proof Assistant 
-------------------

The Coq Proof Assistant is a required package for both CompCert as well as Frama-C. 
You need to install the Coq Proof Assistant via opam as shown below:

::

    opam install coq.8.6.1
    eval `opam config env`

CompCert Certified Compiler 
---------------------------

The CompCert compiler is used to compile the C code for verified uberobjects within 
|uspark|. The Compcert version currently supported is v3.1 and can be installed 
as shown below:

::

    wget http://compcert.inria.fr/release/compcert-3.1.tgz 
    tar -xvzf compcert-3.1.tgz 
    cd CompCert-3.1 
    ./configure x86_32-linux 
    make all
    sudo make install 
    cd ..


Frama-C Verification Framework 
------------------------------

The Frama-C verification framework is used to discharge uberobject invariants and
properties within |uspark|. The Frama-C version currently supported is 
``Phosphorus-20170501`` and can be installed as shown below:

::

    wget http://frama-c.com/download/frama-c-Phosphorus-20170501.tar.gz 
    tar -xvzf frama-c-Phosphorus-20170501.tar.gz 
    cd frama-c-Phosphorus-20170501 
    ./configure 
    make 
    sudo make install 
    cd ..
   
You will also need to install Frama-C backend theorem provers such as
CVC3, Alt-Ergo and Z3. The WP Frama-C plugin manual referenced below
contains a chapter on installing the theorem provers:

.. parsed-literal::

    http://frama-c.com/download/wp-manual-Phosphorus-20170501.pdf

.. note:: You will need to install the correct versions of Why3 and the 
          provers as described in the aforementioned Frama-C WP plugin manual.
          For example,  Why3 version 0.87.3 and Alt-ergo version 1.30. This can be 
          done via opam as shown below in the context of Why3:

::

    opam install why3.0.87.3

.. note:: Opam might show instructions on how to install additional OS dependencies if
          needed during the installation of Why3 and the provers. Usually such 
          dependencies are satisfied by using opam depext prior to installing Why3 and 
          the provers. An example is shown below in the context of Why3:

::

    opam depext camlzip.1.07
    opam depext conf-pkg-config.1.1
    opam depext conf-gtksourceview.2

Verifying, Building and Installing |uspark| Libraries
======================================================

The |uspark| core libraries provide commonly used runtime functionality
for a uberobject. The core libraries current comprise a tiny C runtime 
library, a fledging crypto library (currently SHA-1 supported) and a 
library for platform hardware access. 

This section of the documentation will describe how you 
can verify, build and install the aforementioned libraries. For the
subsections that follow, you need to be in the top-level of the
|uspark| source repository.


Verifying |uspark| Libraries
-----------------------------

To verify the |uspark| libraries first switch to the |uspark| 
library sources:

::

   cd src/libs

Then prepare for verification and subsequent build:

::

    ./bsconfigure.sh
    ./configure


And, finally verify the libraries using:

::

    make verify-ubersparklibs


.. note:: The verification typically takes a few minutes to complete and should finally 
          terminate with a success message.


Building |uspark| Libraries
----------------------------

|uspark| |uobj| runtime libraries are built using the certified CompCert compiler
in combination with |uspark| tools (to handle Assembly as CASM). To build the 
|uspark| libraries you need to use the following command:

::

   make build-ubersparklibs 
   

Installing |uspark| Libraries
------------------------------

|uspark| libraries are installed to the development system using the following
command:

::

    sudo make install


.. note:: The libraries are installed to the default location ``/usr/local/uberspark`` but can
          be over-ridden by the ``--prefix`` option during configuration using the ``configure``
          utility.
